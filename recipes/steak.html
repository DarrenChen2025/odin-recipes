        <h2>Cooking Ingredients Needed </h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <p><li>1 1¾"-thick bone-in rib eye (about 1½ lb.)</li></p>
                    <p><li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li></p>
                    <p><li>2 tsp. vegetable oil</li></p>
                    <p><li>3 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li></p>
                    <p><li>2 sprigs rosemary</li></p>
                    <p><li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li></p>
                    <p><li>Flaky salt</li></p>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Season steak generously with kosher salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature 1 hour.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Heat a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high, then add oil. 
                        As soon as oil is smoking, cook steak, turning every 2 minutes or so, until a deep 
                        brown crust forms and the internal temperature is a few degrees below your favored 
                        doneness (120°–125° for medium-rare), 8–10 minutes.</li>
                        <p></p>
                    <li>Add butter, rosemary, and garlic to skillet, tilt pan toward you so that butter pools 
                        on one side, and use a large spoon to continually baste steak with butter. Continue 
                        until butter is no longer bubbling and it smells nutty and is beginning to brown, 
                        about 1 minute. Transfer meat to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. 
                        (For medium-rare, your steak should reach an internal temperature of 125°–130°.)</li>
                        <p></p>
                    <li>Cut meat from bone and slice against the grain 1" thick. Spoon some infused 
                        brown butter over steak and sprinkle with sea salt.</li>
                </ol>
